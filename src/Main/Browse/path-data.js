First, you will learn the ins and outs of AWS Systems Manager and what you can use it for in terms of automation and operations. Next, you will discover the several services built around monitoring and maintaining compliance requirements for your accounts. Finally, you will explore how to optimize your S3 storage usage by incorporating numerous tools built-in to the service itself. When you are finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge of AWS services needed to optimize all of your AWS operations fully."
